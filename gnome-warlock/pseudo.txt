PSEUDOCODE!

Gameboard is square
Gnome (player) generates in the middle
Gnome goes first
Enemies go second (in order of appearance on board)
On each turn, gnome can move 1 and perform an action
On each turn, enemies can either move or perform action (maybe)
Survival, game gets harder as you go on, ends only when you die

Setup
1) create board based on side (tile divs)
    nested for loops to give row/column, x/y values
2) create gnome (div)
    object from class with health, mana(maybe), lives(maybe), inventory
3) replace center div with gnome

Start Game
1) enemy appears (Random along border?)
    object from class with health and type
2) player move/action (or action/move)
3) enemy move/action (or action/move)
    etc.

Player moves
    1) move to tile top/right/bottom/left (or maybe any surrounding) (optional)
    2) attack (melee/ranged) (optional)
    3) end turn (automated if move and action completed?)

Enemy moves
    1) move to tile top/right/bottom/left (or maybe any surrounding)

Notes on movement:
    Can't move into occupied space (walls/enemies)
    Can move then attack or attack then move
